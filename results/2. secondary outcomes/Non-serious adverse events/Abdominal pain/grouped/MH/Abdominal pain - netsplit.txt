Legend:
 comparison - Treatment comparison
 k          - Number of studies providing direct evidence
 nma        - Estimated treatment effect (OR) in network meta-analysis
 direct     - Estimated treatment effect (OR) derived from direct evidence
 indir.     - Estimated treatment effect (OR) derived from indirect evidence
 RoR        - Ratio of Ratios (direct versus indirect)
 z          - z-value of test for disagreement (direct versus indirect)
 p-value    - p-value of test for disagreement (direct versus indirect)

Percent of comparisons where there is some evidence (p-value<0.05) of disagreement between direct and indirect sources: 0. (0 out of 1 comparisons).
